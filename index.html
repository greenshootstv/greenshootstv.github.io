      <span style="font-family: GE Inspira;"> The weblinks provided tell a
        different narrative from the corporate news.&nbsp; I have spent many
        hours and sleepless nights looking for balanced and truthful news on the
        COVID topic.&nbsp; This is undoubtedly becoming harder with the massive
        censorship crack down on dissenting voices like mine.&nbsp; Credible
        news articles are extremely hard to find!&nbsp; Please take your time to
        read reports, which are news, anti spin, straight to the point, clear
        and free of emotive story telling.&nbsp; Open up your mind to the truth
        of the COVID crisis.&nbsp; The corporate media cartel have flooded the
        web with a tsunami of panic striven misinformation, drip fed state
        backed propaganda.&nbsp; Their central aim is to wear us down to the
        point of accepting the vaccines, the health passports, and an ever more
        top down control on our lives whilst making a tidy profit.&nbsp; Do you
        really want to live in a society where we are coerced to undergo medical
        treatments we dont need, be tested everywhere we go (sick until proven
        healthy) and wear masks, which are extremely unhealthy and give us
        stinky breath.&nbsp; This goes against the human spirit and a free
        society.&nbsp; I have decided to dedicate my time to this issue because
        things will get worse if we do not arm ourselves with knowledge.&nbsp;
        Do you want this to be our new normal for yourself and for your family?
        &nbsp; Get up to speed and understand what is happening, and spread the
        message.</span></p>
