      <span style="font-family: GE Inspira;"> The weblinks provided tell a
        different narrative from the corporate news.&nbsp; I have spent many
        hours and sleepless nights looking for balanced and truthful news on the
        COVID topic.&nbsp; This is becoming harder with all the censorship going
        on.&nbsp; Credible news articles are extremely hard to find!&nbsp;
        Please take your time to read reports, which are news not spin, straight
        to the point, clear and free of emotive story telling.&nbsp; Open up
        your mind to the truth of the COVID crisis.&nbsp; The corporate media
        cartel have flooded the web with a tsunami of panic striven
        misinformation, drip fed state backed propaganda.&nbsp; Their aim in my
        opinion is to wear us down to the point of accepting the vaccines, the
        health passports, and an ever more top down control on our lives whilst
        making a tidy profit.&nbsp; Do you really want to live in a society
        where we are coerced to undergo medical treatments we dont need, be
        tested everywhere we go (sick until proven healthy) and wear masks,
        which are extremely unhealthy and give us stinky breath.&nbsp; This goes
        against the human spirit and a free society.&nbsp; I have decided to
        dedicate my time to this issue because I do not want to live in this
        world for me, and for any of my family!&nbsp; Get up to speed and
        understand what is happening, and spread the message.</span></p>
