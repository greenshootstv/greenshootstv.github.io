    <p style="text-align: left;"><strong id="sh">masks - a display of
        righteousness</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;" id="text">So youve decided to wear the mask
      that has limited beneficial resistance to the spread of a respiratory
      virus, infact if you look at studies that have been conducted for at least
      the last hundred years most show that actually wearing any type of face
      covering will infact spread more virus. Most viruses are spread by
      touching things and then touching your nose and mouth. I often see people
      taking their mask off to scratch their nose, or even sneeze. I haa friend
      who socially awkward, condition us to fear contribute towards technocry
      that will lead to our enslavement symbolic of your compliance to social
      conditioning that will lead to your state injectable you decided that
      shallow and insignificant gestures are much easier way to showcase your
      morality than actually being moral, because in order to be a real good
      person youve got to stand up to a real bad perso and since you dont want
      to stand up to anyone makes you a coward, so youve decided to trick your
      own mind into thinking compliance is a virtue instead of what it actually
      is, it cowardice Float through life completely ignorant to the fact that
      every socialist takeover has always begun in the exact same way; public
      shaming, censorship and a toilet paper shortage. Im not kidding, go look
      up communist Russia and eastern Europe. So stand by, turn a blind eye to
      history repeating itself again So you prefer to mark people who fight back
      and stand their ground "conspiricy theorists" and "your wasting your life"
      "whats the point, you cant change anything", "all we can do is get on with
      our lives". I say the point is if we dont try and derail this agenda there
      will be no life worth going back to to get on with. So you dont have to do
      your own research. Im sorry does this take your precious "me time away"?
      So I respectfully suggest, with urgency to all the so called "normies"
      roll your sleeve up, get up to speed because the window of opportunity is
      closing fast. </p>
