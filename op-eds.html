        style="font-family: monospace;">So, youve decided to wear the mask that
        has limited beneficial resistance to the spread of the virus.&nbsp; We
        have decided to collectively become responsible for one another in this
        time of need.&nbsp; Is this a nobel faithed effort to help our
        neighbours and engage in good community spirits?&nbsp; Upon relection I
        say it is plain cowardise.&nbsp; However, most people would say "its
        about showing solidarity and making each other feel safe.&nbsp; "We
        should all wear some sort of face covering anyway even before the
        virus"&nbsp; Really...?&nbsp; This is an actual sentance that that was
        uttered from a neighbours mouth.&nbsp; I was there when they uttered
        this idiocy.&nbsp; Coincidentally his virtueness came after our overlord
        rulers made it mandatory accompanying a fine of Â£100.&nbsp; Funny how
        peoples good will kicks-in at exactly same time when they're threatened
        by the central government.<br>

    <div style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span
        style="font-family: monospace;">Studies show after the Kansus Flu,
        generally know as the more innacurate nomenclature "Spanish flu" of 1918
        actually proved wearing any type of face covering will infact make the
        situaltion worse.&nbsp; Even medical journalists and mainstream news
        outlets actually attributed the second wave to habitual wearing of the
        masks.&nbsp; Most viruses are spread by touching things and then
        touching your nose and mouth.&nbsp; You need a huge virual load to
        spread a pathogen.&nbsp; As a species we have very good insticts and
        often ameliorate this by visual scanning and skirt around that person
        who is ill.&nbsp; This everso clever thing called evolution has designed
        this almost full proof mechanism for dealing with such events.&nbsp; Its
        called symptoms.&nbsp; How often do you go to work or hug your granny
        (for gods sake) when you are fluey?&nbsp; Only morons do this.&nbsp; I
        often see people taking their mask off to scratch their nose or even
        sneeze.&nbsp; I have a friend who is frightened to death of the
        coronavirus, wears his mask religiously, and keeps it hung up on the
        rear view mirror.&nbsp; He hasnt washed it for 400 days or so, but im
        sure thats not going to contribute in any negative way to his health or
        mine.</span></div>

    <div style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span
        style="font-family: monospace;"> So what pathegens are we actually
        breading in our so called "face coverings".&nbsp; We are breeding a
        socially awkward society, based on a global fear campaign.&nbsp; The
        mask is a symbolic geasture of your compliance to social
        conditioning.&nbsp; In turn leading to your state injectable.&nbsp;
        Fools have decided that shallow and insignificant gestures are a much
        easier way to showcase their morality than actually being moral.&nbsp;
        In order to be a good person you are forced to stand up to a real life
        bad person, and since you dont want to stand up to anyone this makes you
        a coward.&nbsp; You infact have decided to trick your mind into thinking
        compliance is a virtue instead of what it actually is.&nbsp; Are you
        hoping to float through this draconian time of state control, closing
        your eyes hoping it will all go away and we can all get back to
        normal?&nbsp; You are going to be very dissapointed and wake up in a
        world you will not recognise.&nbsp; Are you going to ignore the
        insideious ham fisted 24/7 fear cycle being played out by our
        governement.&nbsp; Do you really think they care about your
        health?&nbsp; It seems like they've been working against you to instill
        fear, public shaming and pure misery.&nbsp; <br>

    <div style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px; text-align: justify;"><span
        style="font-family: monospace;">All governments turn to tyranny once in
        history.&nbsp; Dont turn a blind eye to history repeating itself.&nbsp;
        Marring people who fight back and stand their ground is plain ignorance
        and labeling them "conspiricy theorists" is siding with the very people
        who are working against you.&nbsp; "Your wasting your life", "whats the
        point", "you cant change anything", "all we can do is get on with our
        lives".&nbsp; I say, the point is if we dont try and derail this
        insidious agenda there will be no life worth going back to get on
        with.&nbsp; I know research takes up your precious "me time"?&nbsp;
        However, I respectfully suggest, with urgency you roll your sleeves up,
        get up to speed and join us in our battle, because the window of
        opportunity is closing fast.</span></div>
